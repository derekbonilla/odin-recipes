    <h2>Bánh Xèo - Crispy & Savory Vietnamese Crêpes / Pancakes</h2>
    <p>Banh Xeo is a vibrant and savory Vietnamese dish that captivates both the eyes and the palate with its brilliant yellow hue and enticing aroma. The name "Banh Xeo" translates to "sizzling pancake," a moniker that aptly describes the sizzling sound it makes when the rice batter hits the hot skillet. This crispy, crepe-like pancake is made from a batter of rice flour, water, coconut milk, and turmeric, which gives it its signature yellow color. The pancake is generously filled with a mixture of ingredients that can vary by region but commonly includes slices of pork, shrimp, diced green onion, and bean sprouts.
    <br>
    Once the edges of the Banh Xeo turn golden and crispy, it's carefully folded in half, encasing the hearty filling. It's typically served with a side of fresh herbs like basil, mint, and cilantro, as well as lettuce leaves. To enjoy, pieces of the pancake are wrapped in the lettuce along with herbs and then dipped in Nuoc Cham, a flavorful Vietnamese dipping sauce made from fish sauce, lime juice, water, sugar, and chili peppers. This combination of textures and flavors—crunchy, soft, savory, sweet, and tangy—makes Banh Xeo a delightful and interactive eating experience that's deeply rooted in Vietnamese culinary tradition.</p>

    <h3>Instructions/Steps</h3>
        <h4>Prepare Batter</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine all batter ingredients except scallions in a large bowl for at least 3 hours, or overnight. Add scallions only right before making the crepes.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Prepare Fillings</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Steam or soak mung beans in water until soft.</li>
                <li>Boil pork until cooked through and soft, then slice thinly.</li>
                <li>Remove shrimp heads and devein shrimp if desired.</li>
                <li>Wash bean sprouts and veggies.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Cooking</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>On medium-high heat add 1-2 teaspoons of oil and some onions
                </li>
                <li>Immediately add a few pieces of pork and shrimp. Sauté, lightly mixing until very lightly browned and fragrant.
                </li>
                <li>Pour in some batter and quickly tilt & rotate the pan so the batter is evenly spread. Add more batter if it wasn't enough to cover the pan. There should only be a thin layer of batter that almost flakes off at the pan edges where it's thinner. If your batter doesn't do that and is too thick, add a few tbsp water to the batter and mix to thin it out.
                </li>
                <li>Lower the heat to medium. Add some mung beans, bean sprouts, and cover with a lid for about 3 minutes, or until bean sprouts are slightly cooked. The batter should also be slightly cooked and transparent around the edges. This step cooks the top side of the ingredients and batter while it steams since we won't be flipping the crepe.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the lid, lower heat to medium-low and wait for the crêpe to become crisp. This takes about 5-7 minutes. This step lets the ingredients fully cook through, including the batter. It also lets steam escape so the batter can crisp up. Brush on a little oil around the edges if you're not seeing or hearing enough batter to pan contact. Fold in half, transfer to a plate and serve immediately. For batter troubleshooting please see the troubleshooting section in the post above.
